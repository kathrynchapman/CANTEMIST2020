The Cantemist corpus was manually annotated by clinical experts following the Cantemist guidelines.  These guidelines contain rules for annotating morphology neoplasms in Spanish oncology clinical cases; as well as for mapping these annotations to https://eciemaps.mscbs.gob.es/ecieMaps/browser/index_o_3.html CIEO-3 (Spanish version of ICD-O-3,https://www.who.int/classifications/icd/adaptations/oncology/en/).

Guidelines were created de novo by clinical experts in three phases:
 - First, a zero version of guidelines after the clinical experts reviewed neoplasm morphology annotations in SPACCC corpus see Codiesp guidelines(https://zenodo.org/record/3730567).
 - Second, a stable version of guidelines was reached while annotating sample sets of Cantemist corpus iteratively until quality control was satisfactory.
 - Third, guidelines are iteratively refined as manual annotation continues.
